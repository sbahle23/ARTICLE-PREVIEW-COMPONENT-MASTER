### What I learned

During this project, I developed my skills in building responsive and accessible websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to write well-structured, semantic code and create interactive elements like a mobile-friendly navigation menu. One of the main challenges I faced was making sure the layout adapted properly to various screen sizes, which pushed me to improve my use of media queries. Troubleshooting JavaScript issues also tested my patience but helped me strengthen my problem-solving approach. Overall, this experience boosted my confidence and deepened my understanding of front-end development.
